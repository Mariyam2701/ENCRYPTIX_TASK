# TASK 1: TO-DO-LIST
This project aims to create a To-Do List application using Python, allowing users to manage and organize their tasks efficiently. The application provides a command-line interface for users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.

## Key Features
- Create and manage to-do lists
- Add new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Display the current to-do list

## Code Overview
## The code is organized into four main functions:
- display_tasks(): Displays the current to-do list
- add_task(): Adds new tasks to the list
- update_task(): Updates existing tasks
- delete_task(): Deletes tasks from the list
The code uses a simple menu-driven interface, where users can choose to view, add, update, or delete tasks. The tasks are stored in a list called tasks, and the code uses indexing to update and delete tasks.

## Key Code Points
- The tasks list stores all the tasks
- The display_tasks() function uses enumeration to display the task number and task name
- The add_task() function uses input to get new tasks and splits them by commas
- The update_task() function uses input to get the task number and new task name
- The delete_task() function uses input to get the task numbers to delete

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple To-Do List application using Python. The code is easy to understand and modify, making it a great starting point for beginners. The application provides a basic but functional interface for managing tasks and can be expanded upon to add more features and functionality.

# TASK 2 CALCULATOR
This project is a simple calculator application written in Python, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. The application provides a command-line interface for users to perform calculations efficiently.

## Key Features
- Addition of two numbers
- Subtraction of two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of two numbers (with error handling for division by zero)
- Continuous operation until the user decides to quit

## Code Overview
The code is structured to repeatedly prompt the user for input and perform calculations based on the selected operation.

- User Input Handling: Prompts users to enter two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation.
- Addition: Adds two numbers and displays the result.
- Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first and displays the result.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers and displays the result.
- Division: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
- Looping Mechanism: Uses a while True loop to continuously prompt the user until they decide to quit by entering 'end'.

## Key Code Points
- User Input: Utilizes input() to gather numbers and the operation choice from the user.
- Error Handling: Includes mechanisms for handling invalid numeric inputs and invalid operation choices.
- Arithmetic Operations: Implements basic arithmetic operations with appropriate prompts and displays for results.
